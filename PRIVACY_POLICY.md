## PRICACY POLICY FOR BOOM CHESS

Welcome to the BOOM CHESS app for Android!

This is an open source Android app developed by Marty Lauterbach. The source code is available on GitHub under the CC0 1.0 Universal; the app is also available on Google Play.

As an avid Android user myself, I take privacy very seriously.
I know how irritating it is when apps collect your data without your knowledge.

I hereby state, to the best of my knowledge and belief, that I have not programmed this app to collect any personally identifiable information. 
The app does not create any data, store any data on your device except the initial download, or sends any data, not even debug files, anywhere. 
Every time you open the app, it is as if you have opened it for the first time. 

The app does not need any permissions. It does not send any notifications. 

### Explanation of permissions requested in the app

The list of permissions required by the app can be found in the `AndroidManifest.xml` file:
